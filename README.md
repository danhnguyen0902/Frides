VIET TECH APP
Client Name: Tung Nguyen­ President of Viet Tech organization
Organization: Viet Tech organization

As every new semester comes, there are new Vietnamese or Vietnamese American students coming to study at Virginia Tech. They are young, energetic and new to everything at Tech, so it will be better if they can get helps from other people who have already been there before, and that’s how Viet Tech comes in place.

Viet Tech was founded in 2010, originally a small group of international Vietnamese students at Virginia Tech. It has been grown to approximately 45 members in the Fall 2015. Its mission is to help Virginia Tech’s Vietnamese (especially the ones who come to the U.S. for the first time) with cultural adjustment/integration in U.S. college environment. 

When they just get into college, most of them don’t have any means of transportation, and the places are new to them. Also, Viet Tech organization occasionally meets every month at different locations to have a small party together. The way members in Viet Tech communicate is mainly through FB chat messenger or phones, but sometimes on the day the event is taking place, it gets really frustrating when they cannot communicate due to various reasons such as phone runs out of battery, there’s no internet at their current location, etc. Therefore, there’s a huge need of a mobile app that can help to solve this problem, which they can easily notify each other beforehand who will need a ride and who will be available to offer it on the day the event is going to happen.
